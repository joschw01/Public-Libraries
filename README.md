# Public Libraries
 A dive into 2021 Public Library Data. Viewable at https://nbviewer.org/github/joschw01/Public-Libraries/blob/main/PubLib.ipynb 

## About
This is a dive into data available about public libraries in the United States. I will be updating the files as I work through exploratory data analysis and beyond, so everything is likely to be a little rough. If you have comments, questions, or suggestions, please contact me at joe.schweiss@icloud.com

I currently using VS Code on both Windows and MacOS platforms, updating GitHub via GitHub desktop and the command line, and primarily working with Altair for visualization purposes.

## Background
As a former librarian and forever data explorer, I wanted to dig into some of the information on public libraries that was available from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. My initial work will be exploring the latest data, which at this time is the 2020-21 Public Libraries Survey (available at https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey). I worked in both Kentucky and Maine, meaning most of this information is new to me, and though so much of what makes a library work is nuanced perhaps some of my questions can be answered by exploration and analysis of hard data.  Areas of interest include:
* How well funded are public libraries throughout the country?
* How well used are public libraries throughout the country?
* What factors contribute to use by the public?
* What aspects of use boil down to funding, access, and other factors?

## Soapbox
I truly believe in the power of libraries to inform and transform users for the better. Somehow, though, public libraries remain undiscovered and/or unappreciated by many; untrusted and attacked by some. Libraries offer entertainment, resources, and public spaces to everyone, along with the training to understand what information can and cannot be trusted. Some will say that libraries are unnecessary because one can find "anything" on the Internet. Folks can also find water in puddles on the street, but that does not make it safe to consume.
