# Public Libraries
 A dive into 2021 Public Library Data

## Background
As a former librarian and forever data explorer, I wanted to dig into some of the information on public libraries that was available from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. My initial work will be exploring the latest data, which at this time is the 2020-21 Public Libraries Survey (available at https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey).
